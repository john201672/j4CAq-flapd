                        <p>The singer visited Chelsea Fire Station on Monday to show her appreciation</p>
                        <p>Adele has shown her support for firefighters who tackled the blaze at Grenfell Tower by stopping by their fire station for "a cup of tea and a cuddle". The 29-year-old pop star paid a visit to Chelsea Fire Station to meet some of the brave individuals who fought the fire in Kensington, and the team were understandably delighted by her surprise stopover. Sharing a series of photos on Facebook, firefighter Rob Petty wrote: "Not everyday the wonderfully grounded and caring Adele pops into Chelsea Firestation for a cup of tea and a cuddle X."</p>

                        <p><img src="/img/p1.jpg" class="lazyload"><p>Adele paid a surprise visit to Chelsea Fire Station on Monday</p></p>

                        <p>The visit comes after the Hello singer spent time comforting those affected by the tragedy while attending a vigil for the victims, less than 24 hours after the fire took hold of the 24-storey building. Onlookers said the star seemed emotional as she spoke to those around her, and that she hugged a number of local residents. She was widely praised on social media for her actions. "Such a humble & down-to-earth woman," one wrote. Another said: "The fact that Adele has gone to Grenfell Tower and not said a word about it just proves his amazingly sincere she is…"</p>

                        <p><img src="/img/p2.jpg" class="lazyload">The pop star happily posed for pictures with firefighters</p>
                        <p>Police have so far named five victims of the fire – 79 people died or are missing presumed dead. Authorities have warned the final number of victims from the fire in the 24-storey block could still change. Commander Stuart Cundy said his priority was to identify the people who died in the building and to remove them as quickly as possible. But he warned that not everyone would be identifiable and the operation would take "many, many weeks". "This is an incredibly distressing time for families," he said. "It is really hard to describe the devastation the fire caused."</p>
                        <p>Adele has shown her support for all those affected by the fire at Grenfell Tower by making a low-key appearance at the site on Wednesday night. The Tottenham-born pop star and her husband Simon Konecki attended a vigil being held for victims and survivors in the shadow of the north Kensington tower. Onlookers said the star seemed emotional as she spoke to those around her, and that she hugged and comforted a number of victims. The 29-year-old has been widely praised on social media for her actions. "Such a humble & down-to-earth woman," one wrote. Another said: "The fact that Adele has gone to Grenfell Tower and not said a word about it just proves his amazingly sincere she is…"</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p3.jpg" class="lazyload"><p>Adele has visited Grenfell Tower to show her support for victims of the fire</p></p>

                        <p>Adele is one of a number of stars to offer help to those affected by the tragedy. Jamie Oliver offered free food and shelter at his nearby restaurant in Shepherd's Bush. Lily Allen and Emma Freud opened up their homes to residents needing a place to stay. YouTube sensation Jim Chapman offered to pay for hotel rooms, tweeting: "I'm going to book a few hotel rooms near Greenfell Tower. Get in touch if you have nowhere to stay and I'll try to get you a roof over your head." Tamara Ecclestone and Jeremy Clarkson, meanwhile, were among those who donated clothes, toiletries and other items to help those affected by the fire.</p>
                        <p>So far, 12 people are confirmed to have died in the fire. Firefighters were called to the residential tower shortly before 1am on Wednesday morning, at a time when "several hundred" people were thought to have been inside. Flames could still be seen almost 24 hours after the blaze started, and fire teams continued to work throughout Wednesday night to dampen the fire. Police have warned that the number of deaths is expected to rise. Currently, 34 people remain in hospital – 18 of whom are in a critical condition.</p>
